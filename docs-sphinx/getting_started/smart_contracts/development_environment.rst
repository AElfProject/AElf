Development Environment
=======================

Before you begin the tutorials, you need to install the following tools and frameworks.

**Please note that if you are solely interested in learning smart contract development, 
you only need to install the .NET SDK. Other tools are used to start aelf nodes, publish contracts, and more. 
The installation of these tools is optional, and you can install them as needed.**

For most of these dependencies, we provide command-line instructions for macOS, Linux (Ubuntu 18), and Windows.
If you encounter any issues or have more complex requirements, please leave a message on GitHub, 
and we will address them as soon as possible.

macOS
-----

Configure Environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can install and set up the development environment on macOS
computers with either Intel or Apple M1/M2 processors. This will take 10-20
minutes.

Before You Start
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Before you install and set up the development environment on a macOS
device, please make sure that your computer meets these basic
requirements:

-  Operating system version is 10.7 Lion or higher.

-  At least a 2Ghz processor, 3Ghz recommended.

-  At least 8 GB RAM, 16 GB recommended.

-  No less than 10 GB of available space.

-  Broadband internet connection.

**Support for Apple M1**

If you use a macOS computer with an Apple M1 chip, you need to install
Apple Rosetta. Open the Terminal on your computer and execute this
command,Please be patient while the command is executed.

.. code:: powershell

   /usr/sbin/softwareupdate --install-rosetta --agree-to-license

Install Homebrew
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In most cases, you should use Homebrew to install and manage packages on
macOS devices. If Homebrew is not installed on your local computer yet,
you should download and install it before you continue.

To install Homebrew:

1. Open Terminal.

2. Execute this command to install Homebrew:

   .. code:: bash

      /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

3. Execute this command to check if Homebrew is installed:

   .. code:: bash

      brew --version

The following output suggests successful installation:

.. code:: bash

   Homebrew 3.3.1

   Homebrew/homebrew-core (git revision c6c488fbc0f; last commit 2021-10-30)

   Homebrew/homebrew-cask (git revision 66bab33b26; last commit 2021-10-30)
