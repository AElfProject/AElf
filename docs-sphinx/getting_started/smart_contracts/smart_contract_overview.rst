Smart contracts Overview
========================

This section provides the knowledge you need to write smart contracts
and it will take you around 40 minutes to go through the whole tutorial.
You can follow the instructions along with the examples to learn how to
set up the development environment via C# and AElf-tools. The
instructions will walk you through the development, test, and deployment
/update of smart contracts. There are 2 types of smart contract
deployment/update: one requires BP's approval and the other does not.
You can find in the tutorials the scenarios where each type is
applicable.

The core of blockchain platforms can be viewed as a distributed
multi-tenant database that stores the status of all the smart contracts
deployed on it. Once deployed, each smart contract will have its unique
address. The address will be used to query the execution status of the
contract and can work as an identifier for status queries and updates.
The contract code defines the details of these and updates, to be
specific, how to check whether an account has permission to operate them
and how the operation is completed.
