# Smart Contract Overview

This section provides the knowledge you need to write smart contracts and it will take you around 40 minutes to go through the whole tutorial. You can follow the instructions along with the examples to learn how to set up the development environment via C# and Boilerplate. The instructions will walk you through the development, test, and deployment of smart contracts.

The core of blockchain platforms can be viewed as a distributed multi-tenant database that stores the status of all the smart contracts deployed on it. Once deployed, each smart contract will have its unique address. The address will be used to query the execution status of the contract and can work as an identifier for status queries and updates. The contract code defines the details of these  and updates, to be specific, how to check whether an account has permission to operate them and how the operation is completed.
