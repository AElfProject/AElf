# Node

If you already know something about aelf blockchain and want to get deeply involved, you can proceed with the following and run your own node.

If you are a beginner or you want to deploy contracts onto aelf, please click [here](https://docs.aelf.io/en/latest/getting-started/smart-contract-development/index.html) to learn more.



## Why Should I Run a Node

- Full node: A full node stores the complete blockchain data and you can view all the info. It also enables you to deploy DApps and contracts on aelf or interact with its contracts.

- BP: To run a full node that produces blocks, the node needs to participate in the election. If ranked among the top 2N+1 (N=8 in the first year and increases by 1 every year. Currently the threshold is 17), it can get involved in the governance of aelf.
