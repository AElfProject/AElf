# Welcome to AElf's official documentation.

This site is where we centralize our guides, documents and api references. Wether you're a dApp developer looking to build some awesome apps on top of AElf or simply just interested in seeing what a running node looks like, this place is for you!

As of today the documentation is correct but still a work in progress so we invite you to frequently visit and discover any new content.
