## Smart contract events

#### Event option

During the execution, Events are used internally to represent events that have happened during the execution of a smart contract. The event will be logged in the transaction traces logs (a collection of LogEvents.

```json
message Transferred {
    option (aelf.is_event) = true;
    Address from = 1;
    Address to = 2;
    string symbol = 3;
    sint64 amount = 4;
}
```

Notice the ```option (aelf.is_event) = true;``` line which indicates that the **Transferred** message is destined to be an event.

The following code demonstrates how to fire the event in a contract:

```csharp
Context.Fire(new Transferred()
{
    From = from,
    To = to,
    ...
});
```

External code to the contract can monitor this after the execution of the transaction.
