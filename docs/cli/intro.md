## Descriptions

_A CLI tools built for AElf_

We briefly presented AElfs command line tool in the getting started section. We discovered that aelf-command is the client program used for interacting with a node via WEBAPI calls. You can use it for sending transactions, querying the chains state... It also serves as a wallet program to manage your accounts (keys).

## Features

* Get or Set common configs, `endpoint`, `account`, `datadir`, `password`.
* For new learners who are not familiar with the CLI parameters, any lacked parameters will be asked in a prompting way.
* Create a new `account`.
* Load a account by a given `private key` or `mnemonic`.
* Encrypt account info into `keyStore` format and save into files.
* Get current `Best Height` of the chain.
* Get `block info` by a given `height`.
* Get `transaction result` by a given `transaction id`.
* Send a `transaction` or call a `read-only method` on a smart `contract`.
* Deploy a smart `contract`.
* Open a `REPL` for using `JavaScript` to interact with the chain.

## Installing aelf-command

```bash
npm i aelf-command -g
```

## Using aelf-command

### First Step

You need to create a new account or get a account by a `private key` or `mnemonic` you already have.

```bash
aelf-command create

Your wallet info is :
Mnemonic            : great mushroom loan crisp ... door juice embrace
Private Key         : e038eea7e151eb451ba2901f7...b08ba5b76d8f288
Public Key          : 0478903d96aa2c8c0...6a3e7d810cacd136117ea7b13d2c9337e1ec88288111955b76ea
Address             : 2Ue31YTuB5Szy7cnr3SCEGU2gtGi5uMQBYarYUR5oGin1sys6H
✔ Save account info into a file? … no / yes
✔ Enter a password … ********
✔ Confirm password … ********
✔
Account info has been saved to "/Users/young/.local/share/aelf/keyStore/2Ue31YTuB5Szy7cnr...Gi5uMQBYarYUR5oGin1sys6H.json"

```

Here you can get the account info and decide whether to encrypt account info and save into a file.

Examples:
```bash
aelf-command console -a 2Ue31YTuB5Szy7cnr3SCEGU2gtGi5uMQBYarYUR5oGin1sys6H
✔ Enter the password you typed when creating a wallet … ********
✔ Succeed!
