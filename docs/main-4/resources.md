# Resource system

Tokens in AElf are divided into a few categories: native tokens, resource tokens and other user created tokens. The native token of the main net is ELF, currently we have the following resource tokens **RAM**, **CPU**, **NET**, **STO**.

ELF is the main token on the AElf platform, it is used for transaction fees, side-chain indexing fees, deposits for production nodes, and block rewards for production nodes.

The resource tokens are used by the developer to pay for the resource consumption of the application runtime. The developer needs to ensure that there are enough resource tokens to ensure the application runs normally. They use ELF to purchase resource tokens and sell the resource token to ELF by using the **bancor** algorithm.
