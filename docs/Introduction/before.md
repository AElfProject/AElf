## Prerequisits 

Before you jump in to the guides and tutorial you'll need to install the following tools.

# Development framework

Most of AElf is developed with dotnet core, so you will need to download and install the .NET Core SDK before you start:
[download page](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).

# Database

We currently support two key-value databases to store our nodes data: redis or ssdb. Both work well, it's your decision:
- [Redis](https://redis.io/)
- [SSDB](http://ssdb.io/?lang=en) 

# Protobuf

You also need to install protobuf compiler https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/.

#JS 

The js sdk requires NPM.

//TODO: osx or linux may need command lines

osx
```
brew install protobuf
brew install nodejs
brew install npm 
npm -i n 
.....
```
